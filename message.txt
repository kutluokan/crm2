**Summary of Key Points and Action Steps**

## Lesson Overview (Agents & Accuracy Measurement)

- **Agents & Tools**  
  - An “agent” is an LLM-based system that decides which actions (functions/tools) to call to complete a user’s request.  
  - “Tools” are essentially functions (e.g., database queries, APIs, custom logic). The LLM decides which tool to call based on user input.  
  - **Reasoning Loop (ReAct)**: The LLM “thinks out loud,” chooses a tool, observes the result, and repeats until it has enough information to give a final answer.

- **Use Cases & Examples**  
  - **Math Agent**: Uses Python functions as tools for arithmetic, geometry, etc.  
  - **Research Agent**: Uses web search tools and summarization to gather external info and produce a written report automatically.  
  - **SQL / Database Agents**: Off-the-shelf “toolkits” can introspect and query databases autonomously.  
  - **Sales GPT / CRM Agent**: An AI-driven assistant that handles CRM actions, sales outreach, or auto-update tasks.

- **Tool Calling & Function Calling**  
  - LLMs do not execute code directly; instead, they produce structured outputs (JSON or a specified schema) indicating which function to call and what arguments to pass.  
  - You, as the developer, can decide to automatically execute the tool call or require human-in-the-loop approval.

- **Evaluating Agent Performance**  
  - **Manual vs. Automated Evaluation**: Start by checking the agent’s outputs manually for correctness (especially for complex tasks).  
  - **Collecting Accuracy Metrics**:  
    - Accuracy is measured by comparing the agent’s output vs. the expected/“correct” output.  
    - Track key metrics such as “Success vs. Failure Rate,” “Correct Field Updates,” “Response Time,” etc.  
  - **Annotation Tools (Langsmith / Langfuse)**:  
    - Record each run of the LLM + tool calls.  
    - Annotate or label whether the final output was correct or incorrect.  
    - Build up a test dataset of ~20–30 real or plausible user requests and measure how often the agent succeeds.

## Project / Assignment Requirements

1. **Add an AI Feature to Your CRM (or Similar) Application**  
   - You only need **one** AI-driven user flow, but it should be a complete use case (e.g., auto-updating a record, automatically categorizing tickets, generating outreach messages, etc.).  
   - Potential ideas (or create your own at similar complexity):  
     1. **AutoCRM**: Voice/text commands to update a record, log notes, or unlock accounts.  
     2. **Insight Pilot**: Identify trends or predictions from CRM data (e.g., at-risk customers).  
     3. **Outreach GPT**: Generate personalized emails, messages, or follow-ups for leads.  
     4. **Ticket Classifier** (user-suggested example): Automatically classify and prioritize incoming support tickets.

2. **Accuracy & Evaluation**  
   - Prepare ~20–30 test cases that represent typical user requests in your chosen use case.  
   - Capture the input (user request), the expected output, and then measure how well the agent actually performs.  
   - Suggested Metrics (pick at least 2 to show in your final video/demo):  
     - **Error Rate** (how many times it completely fails).  
     - **Latency** (time taken to respond).  
     - **Success Rate of Correct Tool Usage** (did it choose the correct database/API call?).  
     - **Field-Update Accuracy** (did it update the correct field/object?).  

3. **Technical Stack**  
   - You can integrate your agent and evaluation with **Langsmith** or **Langfuse** to track and annotate each run.  
   - In Python, you might use LangChain’s library; if you’re using TypeScript/Next.js, you can use the LangChain TypeScript library.  
   - Deploy everything so that your user flow works end-to-end.

4. **Deadlines & Deliverables**  
   - **Wednesday Check-In**: Provide progress update (no code submission required; just show your approach).  
   - **Friday Submission**:  
     - **Code + Repository**: Show your agent integrated into the CRM, the data it uses, etc.  
     - **Deployment**: Make it live so others can test or view.  
     - **Walkthrough Video**: Demonstrate your AI feature working with real test inputs.  
     - **Accuracy Metrics**: Show how you tracked at least 2 metrics (e.g., success rate, correctness of updates, etc.).

## Action Steps

1. **Define Your AI Use Case**  
   - Choose from the suggested scenarios or create your own.  
   - Outline the exact user flow (e.g., “User says: ‘Update record X with meeting notes…’ Agent calls the correct function to do so.”).

2. **Implement the Agent + Tools**  
   - Write the tool functions (Python or TypeScript) needed for your agent (DB updates, categorization, sending messages, etc.).  
   - Prompt the LLM to use these tools.  
   - Decide whether to auto-execute or confirm with a human-in-the-loop.

3. **Create 20–30 Test Cases**  
   - Make short, realistic scenarios for the AI feature.  
   - Include the user request, the expected outcome, and any relevant database records.

4. **Log & Evaluate**  
   - Connect to **Langsmith** / **Langfuse** (or a custom logging solution) to record each AI run.  
   - Manually annotate the results for correctness.  
   - Calculate or display metrics (error rate, success rate, time taken, etc.).

5. **Finalize & Demo**  
   - Prepare a short video showing the AI feature in action and your evaluation metrics.  
   - Submit your code, deployment link, and all relevant documentation by the Friday deadline.

**Key Takeaway**:  
Focus on **one** complete agent-driven flow that meaningfully solves a CRM-like problem. Measure how well your agent does (accuracy metrics), log the runs in a dashboard (Langsmith/Langfuse), and demonstrate everything in your final submission.
